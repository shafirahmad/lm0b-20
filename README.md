# lm0b-20
LM0B Beginners Jam #20 

# Overview
Try to make a very very  very simple game in less than 28 hours, as that is all the time left in LM0B Beginners Jam #20

As this would be my first game and first pygame, the expectations are low TBH
(It might just be a pong clone)
It ended up being kind of a pong game, with 1 player bouncing a ball up and down.

Instructions provided in-game
